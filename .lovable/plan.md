# Kudo Advisory — Visual Enhancement Plan

## Goal
Rework the **Outcomes** and **Services** sections with new layouts, AI-generated imagery, and subtle animations to break up the text-heavy feel while maintaining the premium dark-theme brand.

---

## 1. Outcomes Section — Side-by-Side Image + Cards Layout
- **Rework the layout** from a simple 4-card grid to a split layout: a large, striking AI-generated photo on one side (e.g. a leadership team in a modern boardroom with data visualizations) and the 4 outcome cards stacked on the other side
- Each card gets a relevant **icon** (target for clarity, shield for governance, rocket for delivery, chart for ROI) to add visual anchoring
- **Scroll-triggered fade-in animations** so cards animate into view as the user scrolls down

## 2. Services Section — Alternating Image-Text Rows
- **Rework from a 6-card grid** to a more visual layout: pair services into rows of 3 cards, with an AI-generated photo banner between or beside each row (e.g. a futuristic office scene, team collaboration around AI dashboards)
- Cards get **hover animations** (subtle scale + shadow lift) for interactivity
- Add a **background accent graphic** or gradient overlay to distinguish this section visually from Outcomes

## 3. AI-Generated Imagery
- Generate **2-3 professional, high-quality images** using AI that match the existing dark teal/gold brand palette:
  - A boardroom/leadership scene for the Outcomes section
  - A tech/collaboration scene for the Services section
- Images will be styled with overlays to blend seamlessly with the dark theme

## 4. Animations Throughout
- **Intersection Observer-based scroll animations**: cards and images fade/slide in as they enter the viewport
- **Staggered entry**: cards animate in sequence (first card, then second, etc.) for a polished feel
- Keep animations subtle and professional — no flashy effects

## Summary
The result will be a more visually dynamic page where the Outcomes and Services sections feel less like walls of text and more like an engaging, premium consulting experience — with professional imagery and smooth animations guiding the eye.
